# What does this project include?
This project contains 3 main files:
- Data logging software application, which allows user to save any variable available on NI SVE on a TDMS file. 
- Data viewer application (unfinished), which allows the user to explore TDMS files from the data logging application in 2 modes: either after logging is done or while logging.
- Shave variable creation wizard, which steps the user to create SV library, deploy, initialize and do all kind of preparation that user needs for the data logging application.
